# Homework #1

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.

	* Variables : A variable is a placeholder for a value that may or may not change. It's a convenient way
	      of naming something so that you can refer to it.
	* Strings : Strings are alphanumeric values enclosed in "" or '', '' is usually preferred
	* Functions (arguments, `return`) : A function is a small program within a program. It usually does a specific thing and can be ran multiple times. When you want to pass things into a function you use arguements enclosed in (). The return statement is used to return a value or result back to the code that called the function
	* `if` statements : If statements allow you to check if a condition is true and if so run some code
	* Boolean values (`true`, `false`) : Boolean values allow you to assign values true or false to variables and typically you will use them in conditional/if statements to see what code you should execute. 


2. Install Node and NPM.  NPM comes packaged with Node. https://nodejs.org/en/download/


3. Install SublimeText3.  If you have another editor that you prefer then you can use that. https://www.sublimetext.com/3


4. Download this project folder from GitHub.


5. Navigate into the downloaded folder using Terminal(Mac) or Command Prompt(Windows).  `ls`(Mac), `dir`(Windows) and `cd <directory_name>` are the commands you need to navigate around.


6. Once you are in the folder type the command `npm install`.  This will fetch all of the needed requirements for the project.


7. Run `npm test` to run the automated tests.  At first all of the tests will be broken.  You will fill out the functions in `exercises.js` to make the tests pass.
